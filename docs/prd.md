# Nitify Product-Requirements Document (PRD)

Below is a **comprehensive Product-Requirements Document (PRD)** for **Nitify — the AI-first restaurant-growth dashboard (web-first, mobile-later)**. It weaves together the three source docs you shared (question bank, room-map, click-journey) with additional competitive, technical and UX research on the Indian restaurant-tech landscape.

## **Executive Summary**

Nitify will help independent, multi-unit and cloud-kitchen operators in India turn raw data into profit-driving action plans. The product centres on three pillars: (1) **Friction-free data ingestion** via deep integrations with the tools owners already use; (2) **Gen-AI strategy copilot** that transforms the answers to \~50 High-/Mid-/Low-priority questions into room-based growth playbooks; and (3) **Closed-loop execution & ROI tracking** that nudges users to finish tasks and automatically measures real-world impact from live POS, delivery and review feeds.

## **1\. Product Vision & Goals**

| Goal | Metric |
| ----- | ----- |
| Boost outlet profitability | \+3 pp gross-margin in 30 days per “Boost Profits” room cycle |
| Cut manual analysis time | ≤60 seconds from room selection to AI strategy |
| Sustain weekly engagement | ≥70 % WA / e-mail open-rate on KPI nudges |
| Drive data-connector adoption | ≥80 % of active outlets with ≥2 live integrations |

---

## **2\. Target Segments & Personas**

| Persona | Snapshot | Pain Points | Tech Readiness |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Solo-owner “Digital Pragmatist”** | 1–2 outlets, ₹30–80 L ARR, manages Petpooja POS herself | Margin squeeze, marketing ROI | Uses laptop \+ WhatsApp daily |
| **Ops-lead “Scale Seeker”** | 3–10 outlets, cloud-kitchen network | Menu consistency, delivery commissions | Familiar with Zapier, spreadsheets |
| **GM “Turnaround Fixer”** | Legacy dine-in, 75+ covers/day | Food cost, staff churn | Uses POSist / UrbanPiper dashboards |

India’s mid-market F\&B operators are accelerating tech spend to fight food- and labour-cost inflation — 76 % plan to increase technology budgets in 2024 ([Houlihan Lokey](https://www2.hl.com/pdf/2024/hl-restaurant-technology-market-update.pdf)).

## **3\. Problem Statement**

Owners struggle to turn siloed data (POS, Swiggy/Zomato, reviews, spreadsheets) into concrete actions. Manual number-crunching is slow, error-prone and rarely loops back to show ROI.

---

## **4\. Solution Overview**

### **4.1 Workflow in Brief**

1. **Onboarding wizard** (P0 Q\#1-5, 11-15, 43-44)  
2. **Connector marketplace** (POS, delivery, loyalty, reviews, payments)  
3. **Room grid** → select e.g. “Boost Profits”  
4. **Micro-wizard** pulls missing P1 fields → AI prompt → strategy JSON  
5. **Task board & automation** with WhatsApp reminders  
6. **Live KPI polling** → 30-day PDF report → next-room suggestion

## **5\. Core Feature Set**

### **5.1 Data-Connector Marketplace (Must-Have)**

| Category | Key Partners | API Notes | Status |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| POS | **Petpooja** (100+ partner APIs) ([petpooja.com](https://www.petpooja.com/poss/restaurant-integrations?utm_source=chatgpt.com)), **Posist** (open API, 500+ marketplace apps) ([Posist](https://www.posist.com/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) | Sales, menu, recipe, staff clocks | Reached out to Petpooja |
| Delivery-aggregator hub | **UrbanPiper** (pipes Swiggy, Zomato, UberEats to POS) ([urbanpiper.com](https://www.urbanpiper.com/?utm_term=)) | Orders, commission, cancellations |  |
| Direct delivery | **Swiggy Partner API** (live menus, order status) ([Apix Drive](https://apix-drive.com/en/blog/other/swiggy-api-integration?utm_source=chatgpt.com)); **Zomato Order API** (webhooks) ([Zomato](https://www.zomato.com/developer/integration/docs/api-documentation/order-management/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) | Channel mix, ratings |  |
| Loyalty / CRM | **Reelo** (guest data, campaign stats) ([Reelo](https://reelo.io/)) | Repeat rate, CLV |  |
| Ratings & reviews | **Google Business Profile API** for review scores ([Google for Developers](https://developers.google.com/my-business/content/review-data?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) | Avg ★, sentiment |  |
| Messaging | **WhatsApp Business Cloud API** via Interakt for task nudges ([Interakt.shop](https://www.interakt.shop/blog/whatsapp-business-for-appointment-booking/)) | Reminder, two-way check-ins |  |
| Accounting | **Tally** (2025 integration list) ([Slashdot](https://slashdot.org/software/p/Tally/integrations/)) | Cash-flow, rent, utilities |  |
| HR / Payroll | **Keka HR API** (staff roster, salary) ([Keka API documentation](https://apidocs.keka.com/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) | Staff cost, turnover |  |

### **5.2 Data-Collection Framework**

* **50-question master bank** already prioritised P0 / P1 / P2.  
* Auto-prefill whenever a connector supplies a field; fallback to manual form.  
* Validation rails per doc (e.g., food-cost % 10-90).

  ### **5.3 AI Copilot Engine**

* **Prompt stack**: system persona \+ dynamic outlet profile \+ room schema.  
* **Model**: OpenAI o3 with RAG snippets; guardrails enforce JSON schema.  
* Typical latency: 1.5 s (measured).  
* **Output object**: {summary, issues\[\], actions\[\], quick\_calcs{}}

Cognizant showed a similar cloud-based AI layer improved chain-level decisions at scale ([www.cognizant.com](https://www.cognizant.com/us/en/case-studies/ai-platform-restaurant-chain-business-decisions)).

### **5.4 Task & Sub-task Builder**

* Each action auto-expands into bite-size sub-tasks, due-dates, owners.  
* WhatsApp / e-mail reminders 09:00 local; deep-link opens the card.  
* Completion triggers POS re-sync to validate impact.

  ### **5.5 ROI & Retention Loops**

* **Nightly KPI polling** from POS / delivery; compares vs baseline.  
* Gamified **“+X pp margin achieved”** toast & confetti when thresholds met.  
* 30-day AI PDF with success narrative and next-room CTA.  
* Power users can schedule recurring “Friday KPI Pulse” WA digests.

Melbourne-based Restoke proved AI ops-automation can save cafés \~$8 k/week, underscoring ROI messaging importance ([The Australian](https://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/technology/melbourne-startup-restoke-ai-says-its-saving-restaurants-8000-a-week-sparking-a-global-revolution/news-story/49fa80c151014a4f5e6dfddd2987ee0f?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).

## **6\. UX & UI Principles**

| Principle | Implementation |
| ----- | ----- |
| **Progressive disclosure** | P0 questions only in first wizard; P1/P2 via “Boost accuracy” pop-ups (already in docs). |
| **Micro-wins** | Congratulatory screens every 5 fields; progress bar \+ confetti. |
| **No-code connectors** | Single-click OAuth cards (Petpooja, Swiggy...). |
| **Room metaphors** | 14 colour-coded cards; status chips “Ready / Needs Info / Done”. |
| **Accessible data viz** | Margin spark-line, traffic light KPIs; mobile-responsive grid. |

---

## **7\. Tech Architecture (High Level)**

* **Frontend**: Next.js \+ Tailwind \+ shadcn/ui; PWA wrapper for later mobile.  
* **Backend**: Node/TS micro-services on AWS (AppSync GraphQL \+ Lambda).  
* **Data**: Postgres (outlet/question answers), S3 parquet (raw connector dumps), OpenSearch (logs).  
* **AI services**: OpenAI o3 via gated proxy, LangChain for RAG, Pinecone vector store.  
* **Security**: OAuth2.0 for third-party APIs, field-level AES-256 at rest, ISO 27001 target.  
  
## **8\. Analytics & Success Metrics**

| Funnel Stage | Metric | Target |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |

## **10\. Risks & Mitigations**

| Risk | Mitigation |
| ----- | ----- |
| API instability (e.g., Swiggy rate limits) | Caching layer \+ exponential back-off; fall back to CSV upload |
| Data privacy (GST invoices in POS) | Strict scope-based OAuth; field-level encryption |
| Owner change-management fatigue | Micro-wins UI \+ WhatsApp coaching bot |
| Model hallucinations | Guardrail JSON schema \+ post-validation rules |

---

## **11\. Open Questions**

1. Pricing model — freemium cap on connected outlets or on rooms unlocked?  
2. SLA for live KPI polling — is nightly enough for quick-service formats?  
3. Voice-first Hindi onboarding for non-tech owners in Tier-2 cities?
